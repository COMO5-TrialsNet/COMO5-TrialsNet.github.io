## Project Overview

The COMO5 project is funded by the [TRIALSNET](https://trialsnet.eu/) Horizon Europe project under the [open call](https://trialsnet.eu/open-call/). 

## Overview

COMO5 aims to explore a novel approach for managing patients with chronic diseases through 5G-enabled telemedicine. This approach involves using unobtrusive devices for continuous monitoring, offering rapid availability for live consultations with clinicians.

## Use Case Description

COMO5 considers an Use Case of patients affected by chronic diseases, specifically patients affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive chronic lung disease. The goal is to assess the oppor-tunity to improve the efficiency of their management via a new approach based on telemedicine. Patients’ conditions are monitored continuously via a kit of unintrusive devices, specifically a smartphone, a smart-watch and a portable spirometer, see figure below.

Such devices are connected to the internet via a 5G connection, which is exploited on one side for real-time data transmission, on the other, to allow patients for live interaction with healthcare professionals, whenever it is required by their conditions. Data collected from each patient is transmitted to a data collection platform that stores and analyses the data to automatically assess the evolution of the disease and detect worsening of patient’s conditions. The platform offers a web interface for healthcare providers that can be used to monitor the data received by the patients and the results of the data analysis. The interface can also be used to provide feedback, suggest changes in the protocol or request extra measurements (e.g., more frequent ECG or extra spirometer measurements) to the patients. Such information / requests are visualized on the smartphone by the patient. 

Two different modes of opera-tions are defined for the system: stable and deteriorating. Patients in stable conditions have a stable outlook and the disease currently under control, instead, patients with deteriorating conditions are worsening and that requires a fine-grained collection of data, supported by the 5G network via dynamic reconfiguration, and, if requested by the patient or by the clinician, a live consultation to assess the overall condition remotely and recommend hospitalization or changes in the treatment protocol.

The proposed approach is integrated with the 5G network. An innovative orchestrator will be connected to the COMO5 platform in order to reconfigure the 5G link and ensure that patients in deteriorating conditions has priority over the others, thus allowing real-time data transmission and also live consultation between the patient and the clinician.

### Main Objectives
- Demonstrate the feasibility of continuous, real-time monitoring and the oppurtinities offered by 5G/6G networks.
- Assess the perceived societal and economic impact from the perspective of chronic patients.
